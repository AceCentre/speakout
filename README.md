# Generic Tablet Speaker Box

Many devices used for AAC utilise standard hardware in a specially developed case. Some of these cases are intended to hold specific tablets and add specific functionality such as higher volume and the ability to connect input switches for example.

> As a prescriber or user of a tablet, I want to add additional functionality to a mainstream tablet to keep costs low.

Examples of these types of devices are:

A key issue is that when the tablet manufacturer changes the speficiation or size of the tablet the specialist case becomes obsolete. As the case was manufactured for a relatively small specialist market, this keeps costs high. It can make them expensive for low-income countries.

A better approach is could be develop a back box that could be attached a either a:

- locally manufactured case
- a case that has been developed for the mainstream market where the case cost is lower due to economies of scale

Examples of durable mainstream cases that could be used include:
